This code is the development of a bridge condition assessment program using symbolic mathematics in Python.

If the code does not work, please type "pip install sympy numpy matplotlib" in the CMD window.

Quest 1: A code that takes information about the beam and loads as input and outputs the stress tensor.

Quest 2: A code that additionally takes crack information as input and outputs the stress tensor considering the cracks.

Quest 3: A code that considers ultimate tensile stress, ultimate compressive stress, ultimate sheer stress and evaluates the beam's failure based on Mohrâ€™s criterion theory.
